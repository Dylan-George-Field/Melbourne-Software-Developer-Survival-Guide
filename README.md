# Software Developer Survival Guide üèï
A guide to get you started in the city of Melbourne, Australia
## Welcome to Melbourne
Melbourne is wonderful. It's the cultural hub of Australia and is filled with events, arts, sports, nightlife and a vibrant software community. The city centre is called the CBD or 'central business district'. It's located on the Yarra river and will be your first point of interest.

### Climate

### Clothes
Summer - Shorts and a t-shirt/tank top
Winter -  Coat, pants, wooly socks

## Getting Around
### From the Airpot
There are two airports, Avalon or Tullamarine. Both have a public bus service called [Skybus](https://www.skybus.com.au/).

| Airport      | Destination            | Distance |  Bus  | Uber  |
|--------------|------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Avalon       | Southern Cross Station | 1 hour   |  $25  |  $80  |
| Tullamarine  | Southern Cross Station | 30 min   |  $20  |  $40  |

### Public Transport
You need a [Myki card](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki). It's a pre-paid card you can get from a station or ticket machine. You must tap it 'on' and tap it 'off' when you disembark. You'll get fined if you don't have a valid one. Full fare is about $7 a day and cheaper for students.

The network is confusing. Ask the staff for help to get to your destination.

#### Trams
Are free in the CBD! They follow set routes and are great to get around short distances.

#### Trains
All of them go to the CBD and do a 'city loop'. It's the fastest way to outer suburbs.

The main city stations are:
- Flinders St Station
- Southern Cross
- Melbourne Central Station 

Trains run 24 hours on weekends.

#### Buses
You'll find these anywhere there's no rail.

### Bicycle
Bikes are the best if you work in the city and live within 10km of it. They're a cheap, clean and somewhat unsafe mode of transport. You can get a bike off Facebook Marketplace for $150. You must wear a helmet.

Beware of tram tracks.
### Car/Motorbike
A valid license and registration are required from [Victroads](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/).

A car or motorbike can be obtained from:
- Facebook Marketplace
- [Carsales](https://www.carsales.com.au/)
- [Bikesales](https://www.bikesales.com.au/)

## Where to Stay
A rule of thumb is housing is more expensive the closer you are to the city. A controversial rule of thumb is the best suburbs are on the  South-East side of the bay and generally degrade running counter-clockwise in a circle around the CBD.

### Temporary
Find your feet by living in the CBD and think about moving outwards to save money, more space or a better vibe.
- Airbnb
- Hotel
- Hostel

### Rent
A rental can be found on [www.realestate.com.au/rent/](https://www.realestate.com.au/rent/).

| 2-Bedroom Townhouse | $600      | $40       |
