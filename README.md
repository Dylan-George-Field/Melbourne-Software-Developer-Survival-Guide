# Melbourne-Software-Developer-Survival-Guide
## Welcome to Melbourne
Melbourne is a wonderful place. The CBD (central business district) is where most of the action happens. The centre is around the Burke St/Swanston St and is 1 km around. 
### Climate
Tempratures range from 0 - 40 degrees celsius. Know the time of year you'll arrive you or you'll either freeze or fry.
### Clothing
You may wear whatever you please in the CBD. The further out you go the more you want to dress like a local to avoid unwanted attention. Unless that's your thing ;)
#### Workplace
Most workplaces allow developers to wear casual clothes. The most basic form is jeans and a t-shirt (think Zuck) or any unrevealing top. Skirts not far above the knees. If it's your first day ask someone you know about appropriate dress. Be surprised if you're expected to wear 'buiness attire' like a suit and tie.
#### Casual
Summer - Shorts and a t-shirt/tank top
Winter - You need a coat, pants, wooly socks and maybe even thermals and gloves
## Getting Around
### From the Airpot
#### Tullamarine
##### Taxi
Use Uber or find a Taxi out front. I recommend a Uber for the guaranteed rates. The cars are generally nicer. It may cost $50 AUD.
##### Skybus
The bus is outside the arrival hall and will cost you around $20 each way. It takes you to Southern Cross Station. I recommend this option. Don't worry about your bags, no one will take them https://www.skybus.com.au
### Public Transport
#### Trams
Are free in the CBD! You don't need a card or anything. 
#### Trains
This is the highest value way to get to outer suburbs. All trains run from the CBD. The main stations are:
- Flinders St Station
- Southern Cross
- Melbourne Central Station 
Peak times can be a pain at 8am - 9am/5pm - 6pm weekdays. You'll comforably get a seat otherwise. Trains run 24 hours on weekends. Payment is made with a contactless 'Myki' card. Purchase one at the station under the 'Metro' sign, a machine or from 7-11's and convenience stores. The card costs you $7 for an adult and the same for a day's worth of rides. There are concessions (cheaper) for students.
#### Buses
You'll find these anywhere there's no rail. They suck until you get another form of transport
#### Car/Motorbike
You need a license and a registered vehicle. Go to Vicroads for information on it. We drive on the left hand side. You don't need insurance. If you have an international license get a permit. You will be pulled over.

Australian cars are the cheapest to run and maintain. Go to www.carsales.com/www.bikesales.com. Search for:
- Ford Falcon
- Holden Commodore
- Mitsubishi Magna/380
- Toyota Camry
#### Bicycle
If you live within 7km of the city this is the best, cleanest fastest and unsafe way to travel. Pickup a bike on Facebook Marketplace (via the app) for $150-$200. Get a bike lock or it will get stolen. Use lights at night and wear a helmet or you'll get a fine. Don't ride parallel to tram tracks and cross them carefully when wet. Stick to bike lanes and watch for opening doors.
## Finding a place to stay
### Temporary
#### Airbnb
This is your first entry. You have a bunch of options and budgets. You'll get a private room within 20 minutes of the CBD (city center) for the price of a hostel. You will likely share and if that's not your thing - pay more. Everyone will be friendly though and being with others will help you if it's your first time in the city and feeling anxious.
#### Hostel
You'll find plenty of backpackers in and around the CBD. This will be great to get to Meetups and work as most jobs and transport are centered here. You will share with others
#### Hotel
You're living in comfort. Melbourne has a bunch of options. Check Agoda or your favourite website.
### Permanant
Choose a place close to public transport and a supermarket: Coles or Woolworths. Recommended suburbs for a software developer will be inner-city: 
- CBD (small rooms, convenient)
- Docklands (new, windy, no atmosphere)
- Richmond (football types)
- South Yarra (fashion/party)
- Fitzroy (music/art)
- North Melbourne (Left wing)
- South Melbourne (Right wing)
- St. Kilda (all sorts/beach)
- Further out and it'll become suburbia
#### Sharehouse
This is the most cost effective way to live. Jump on www.flatmates.com. I recommend buying their $35 2-month pack. It sounds like a ripoff but it'll get you ahead. They have a free offering if you're cheap otherwise use facebook marketplace. Be wary of dodgey housemates/ads. Always inspect the property and meet the housemates. You should find a private bedroom within 10km (inner-city) for around $1000/month. Some people take bonds. Go on the lease if you want to be safe. Avoid rough neighbourhoods.

#### Rent
Jump on www.realestate.com.au. This is a great option if you have a family, friend to share or just want to go it alone. You're guaranteed no bullshit. The agent will annoy you but hardly as much as a bad housemate. It will cost you $350+/month for a decent one-bedroom apartment. 

## Finding a Job
If you haven't found one already don't worry. You're a software developer. There's plenty of roles and not enough developers.
### Software Companies
- REA
- Carsales
- Envato
- Zendesk
- There's plenty of agencies and companies 
### Websites
The main job boards are:
- Seek
- Indeed
### Meetups
Hands down the best place to start your search. This is where you'll find like-minded individuals and recruiters. Talk to everyone. I guarantee you will find someone who is looking for a developer or will find someone/company who does. Plus you get free food, beers and you might learn something. Most meetups are in the CBD after 5pm.
### Linkedin
Try your luck and message around. You'll get a couple of messages a week with a good profile and the flag 'let recruiters know I'm looking for jobs'. You'll be flooded. My sisters a recruiter. They all start here. You probably won't find your dream job from a cold messaging recuiter on linkedin.
### Company Career Boards
Look in the sky and find the names of the major companies. Search their career pages.
